title: "Testing Bitcoin Core 28.0 Release Candidates"
authors: [rkrux]
components: ["tests"]

## Notes

- Major versions of Bitcoin Core are released every 6-8 months. See the [Life
  Cycle documentation](https://bitcoincore.org/en/lifecycle/) for full details.

- When all of the PRs for a release have been merged, _Release Candidate 1_
  (rc1) is tagged. The rc is then tested. If any issues are found, fixes are
  merged into the branch and a new rc is tagged. This continues until no major
  issues are found in an rc, and that rc is then considered to be the final
  release version.

- To ensure that users don't experience issues with the new software, it's
  essential that the rcs are thoroughly tested. This special review club
  meeting is for people who want to help with that vital review process.

- This [Bitcoin Core Release Candidate Testing Guide](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/28.0-Release-Candidate-Testing-Guide) provides guidance for testing the release candidate.

- It is recommended to go through the ‚ÄúPreparation‚Äù steps ahead of the meeting, especially if you want to compile from
  source. Verify and confirm the successful installation of v28rc1, as well as v27.1 (older version is used in couple tests).

- Feel free to read the [Release Notes](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/28.0-Release-Notes-Draft)
  and bring ideas of other things you'd like to test!

## Meeting Log

17:00 <stickies-v> #startmeeting
17:00 <stickies-v> hey folks!
17:00 <hernanmarino> hey there !
17:00 <monlovesmango> hello!
17:01 <alfonsoromanz> hello!
17:01 <rkrux55> hey
17:01 <andrewtoth_> hi
17:01 <glozow> hi
17:01 <stickies-v> thank you all for joining us for this testing bonanza! is anyone here for the first time? even if you‚Äôre just lurking, feel free to say hi!
17:03 <stickies-v> rkrux55 has done a wonderful job preparing a guide to facilitate testing the new Bitcoin Core v28 RC1 release, so i'll be handing them the hosting microphone soon
17:04 <stickies-v> just to reiterate: review cub is async. even though we'll be going through tests ~progressively, feel free to continue the conversion on earlier or upcoming tests
17:04 <stickies-v> the goal is to maximally test the new release, so you're highly encouraged to deviate from the guide and test things that you use, want, think you can break, ...
17:05 <stickies-v> with all of that said, and seemingly all familiar faces who very well know how the review club format works - rkrux55 do you want to take it from here?
17:05 <rkrux55> yes thank you stickies-v
17:05 <rkrux55> hello everyone
17:06 <rkrux55> Here's the link to the testing guide: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/28.0-Release-Candidate-Testing-Guide
17:06 <rkrux55> It was suggested to go through the ‚ÄúPreparation‚Äù section ahead of the meeting. If you haven't, this is the time to download/compile the binaries, as per https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/28.0-Release-Candidate-Testing-Guide#preparation
17:07 <rkrux55> Please share if you face any issues in this section
17:08 <rkrux55> And this is the issue to share any feedback on the testing guide: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/30854
17:08 <stickies-v> glozow: using autotools again does feel unnatural already indeed üôà
17:09 <glozow> stickies-v: crazy how fast you can get used to things
17:10 <sipa> you could say it happens... auto-matically üòé
17:11 <glozow> question about section 2 (v3): I assume we need to restart our node with -regtest? So that generate works?
17:12 <stickies-v> if no one's having issues getting started i think we can kick off with the testnet4 test rkrux55 ?
17:12 <Murch[m]> hi
17:12 <glozow> anyone still building?
17:12 <glozow> +1 to moving on
17:13 <rkrux55> yes stickies-v we can start with the first testnet4 test
17:14 <rkrux55> glozow: yes, the node needs to be restarted with regtest, I'll add in the guide
17:16 <rkrux55> this is the link to the first test: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/28.0-Release-Candidate-Testing-Guide#1-testnet4-support
17:16 <glozow> I'll try to do my truc testing on testnet4 :D feels more fun that way
17:16 <rkrux55> in the first test, the intent is to connect to the new testnet4 network in v28
17:16 <rkrux55> glozow: +1
17:17 <glozow> anybody willing to put up a public address on testnet4 to connect to?
17:20 <Murch[m]> Sorry, I don‚Äôt think my node is accessible from outside our network
17:20 <glozow> mine too üòÖ 
17:20 <Murch[m]> Happy to send some testnet4‚ÄØcoins to someone, though
17:21 <Murch[m]> I ‚Ä¶um‚Ä¶ tested the twenty minute exception a few times to mine some
17:22 <glozow> haha
17:22 <glozow> should we all share our bestblockhash?
17:23 <rkrux55> yes
17:23 <stickies-v> ugh the macos codesigning requirement for unsigned binaries is really annoying
17:23 <glozow> would be a way to test https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/30786
17:23 <Murch[m]> I was able to sync to 44,560 and validated that my chaintip 00000000f1925db8a095cd935d9643fe31bab2ae4aa6b9f529086d4df8852df9 like e.g. mempool.space reports for Testnet4 
17:24 <glozow> my chaintip is 00000000629dcb986be904639dc4148b2492ec28cbe84d1ebb9baeb60f9432c6, height 44561
17:24 <glozow> Murch check again?
17:24 <stickies-v> yep i'm also on 00000000629dcb986be904639dc4148b2492ec28cbe84d1ebb9baeb60f9432c6
17:24 <glozow> block probably came in as Murch was typing haha
17:24 <stickies-v> on bitcoin-qt to spice things up!
17:24 <Murch[m]>   {... (full message at <https://matrix.bitcoin.ninja/_matrix/media/v3/download/bitcoin.ninja/bQCkvonBsPqUVfMCIKkfZFNk>)
17:24 <hernanmarino> 00000000629dcb986be904639dc4148b2492ec28cbe84d1ebb9baeb60f9432c6 as well
17:25 <glozow> stickies-v: wow!
17:25 <Murch[m]> Yeah, the block I reported was height 44,560, yours is 44,561
17:25 <rkrux55> mine will take some time to reach the tip
17:25 <glozow> Murch: do you wanna send me some testnet4 coins? using a TRUC? ;) we can sibling evict each other?
17:25 <glozow> tb1qs3zh2razjv5kf355cxrum9m3sdskuf9ful9fdq
17:27 <Murch[m]> mh, lemme see those instructions for creating TRUC transactions
17:27 <rkrux55> shall we move to the second test? if anyone is not facing issues connecting with testnet4
17:28 <glozow> rkrux55: yes
17:28 <rkrux55> alright here's the link to the 2nd test: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/28.0-Release-Candidate-Testing-Guide#2-v3-transactions-truc
17:29 <rkrux55> this tests the v3 transactions along with few features of TRUC - topologically resticted until confirmation transactions
17:30 <rkrux55> such as sibling eviction, being able to replace w/o the need for explicit bip125 signalling
17:32 <Murch[m]> glozow: b8dfef71704812a35cd9be9b88ea60f752b54425ca1af6838fafd014a2fbad00
17:33 <Guest61> Hello
17:34 <rkrux55> Guest61: hey
17:36 <Murch[m]> glozow: It got cnofirmed already :-/
17:37 <glozow> ah crap sorry I didn't see that Murch
17:38 <Guest61> So it‚Äôs over?
17:38 <glozow> I did get the coins though! generous!
17:38 <Guest61> üòÖ
17:38 <glozow> Guest61: we are on section 2, testing TRUC
17:38 <rkrux55> Guest61: here's the link https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/28.0-Release-Candidate-Testing-Guide#2-v3-transactions-truc
17:39 <Guest61> Ahh I have to be on GitHub
17:39 <Guest61> I‚Äôm not familiar with GitHub sorry
17:40 <glozow> Guest61: you don't need a github account, the guide is just a list of instructions. You can download the binaries from the website if you prefer!
17:43 <Murch[m]>  glozow: Here is another: 45e5dae5f42f04d35c6d192e474813ad36048ef81cc44c3ec3a61bf06a393e70
17:43 <glozow> Murch: on it!
17:43 <Murch[m]> damn
17:43 <Murch[m]> Confirmed in 10 seconds
17:44 <Murch[m]> The unknown miner is trolling the testing, aren‚Äôt they?
17:44 <monlovesmango> hahaha
17:44 <Murch[m]> 5 blocks in 13 minutes
17:44 <glozow> I think all miners know when you're testing block functionality and when you're testing mempool functionality
17:44 <Murch[m]> and testing the 20 minute exception rule ^^
17:44 <glozow> if it's the former, they will choose to take 60 minutes
17:44 <glozow> if the latter, they confirm it for you immediately
17:44 <Guest61> Okay thanks
17:45 <Murch[m]> ah, the last two blocks are at actual difficulty
17:45 <Murch[m]> anyway, enjoy the 6 t‚Çø
17:45 <Murch[m]> :p
17:46 <glozow> hahaha. i mean i guess we can build the parent+children before broadcasting but kind of a pain
17:46 <Murch[m]> Anyone else need testnet4 corn, while we are at it?
17:46 <Guest61> Yeah I don‚Äôt know how to do this either. I am real beginner starting from zero
17:47 <Murch[m]> I iterated on my approach, I‚Äôm now using sendall with my address as the unspecified amount, and a fixed amount for you, and using as an option {minconf: 0}
17:47 <rkrux55> Murch: yes please tb1qw8kwpwtvs2y7e3aj4rpu3m498lnedv9txkhw7h
17:47 <rkrux55> murch:
17:49 <Murch[m]> rkrux55: 0108c479401cf81c5715dac49557d7acaa7c5327d173ec583606a924bb258915
17:49 <rkrux55> thank you!
17:49 <Murch[m]> sibling evict me! ^^
17:50 <Murch[m]> I used 13 ·π©/vB
17:50 <Murch[m]> b9811e8fb52a4140892c55344cb23c7ab2582148b8d919d74b4002fe8f2bce79
17:51 <Murch[m]> uh, actually I used an effective feerate of 13, because of it auto bumping the unconfirmed parent
17:51 <Murch[m]> :D
17:51 <Murch[m]> it‚Äôs 29.2‚ÄØ·π©/vB
17:51 <Murch[m]> I used `sendall '["myaddress"]' null "unset" 13 '{"maxconf": 0}'
17:51 <Murch[m]>  * I used \`sendall '\["myaddress"\]' null "unset" 13 '{"maxconf": 0}'`
17:52 <Murch[m]> And confirmed again
17:52 <Murch[m]> hehe, okay, I give up
17:52 <rkrux55> too fast
17:52 <rijndael> im late to the party, but does anyone need any testnet4 corn?
17:53 <Murch[m]> Package RBF will be similarly difficult to pull off
17:53 <rkrux55> shall we take a look at the 3rd test as well? Package RBF: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/28.0-Release-Candidate-Testing-Guide#3-package-rbf
17:53 <glozow> now i understand why the guide is on regtest hahahaaha
17:54 <Murch[m]> glozow: If i build a v3 tx with 0 fee and then a child that spends its output, can I submit it to the mempool and have it end up in the orphanage?
17:54 <rkrux55> glozow: lol
17:54 <glozow> orphanage is only used from p2p
17:54 <glozow> so no, if you're submitting using sendrawtransaction
17:55 <glozow> but you can use submitpackage
17:55 <Murch[m]> right, but can I even spend it in a child if my node doesn‚Äôt know about the parent?
17:55 <Murch[m]> rijndael: Howdy! I think we are good, I asked earlier as well, but thanks for offering
17:55 <glozow> yes
17:56 <Murch[m]> mhkay, I will try then
17:56 <glozow> createrawtransaction and then signrawtransactionwithkey
17:56 <glozow> in signrawtransactionwithkey, you may need to provide scriptPubKey and witnessScript
17:57 <monlovesmango> skill issue question-trying to use the createrawtransaction command but keep getting error "zsh: no matches found: ["txid":"<tx id here>"]
17:58 <monlovesmango> i'm using a txid from listunspent
17:58 <glozow> monlovesmango: did you omit bitcoin-cli maybe?
17:58 <monlovesmango> no i have "bcli28 creatrawtransaction ...."
17:59 <monlovesmango> createrawtransaction*
17:59 <monlovesmango> its where that zsh is part of the error right?
17:59 <glozow> ah, you may need the quotes and stuff
17:59 <monlovesmango> gotcha let me try that
17:59 <glozow> bcli28 createrawtransaction "[{\"txid\": 
17:59 <monlovesmango> hahaha ok will put in all the escapes T.T
18:00 <rkrux55> glozow: +1
18:00 <monlovesmango> thank you
18:00 <glozow> I need to head out now but if anybody has questions in the channel I can get back to them later
18:01 <rkrux55> Thanks everyone for joining and testing! Please continue to see if you can break the release.
18:02 <glozow> thank you rkrux55 for the excellent guide!!
18:02 <rkrux55> thanks glozow for trying it out on testnet4
18:02 <monlovesmango> thank you rkrux55!
18:02 <hernanmarino> thanks all 
18:03 <rkrux55> here's the issue link to provide feedback on the guide: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/30854
18:03 <hernanmarino> btw if anyone has some spare testnet4 coins ....  tb1qjsguw0rgnggx3fxzcrgz803cq82ptn478xswrn
18:04 <rkrux55> #endmeeting
18:08 <Murch[m]> glozow: When I tried to spend the coin created by the first unsubmitted transaction, I got... (full message at <https://matrix.bitcoin.ninja/_matrix/media/v3/download/bitcoin.ninja/keobDwYQMXItGMCsOJGxnXOt>)
18:09 <Murch[m]> <glozow> "in signrawtransactionwithkey..." <- Ah I see.
18:09 <instagibbs> gotta bring that utxo info so it'll sign, possibly
18:10 <Murch[m]> how do I get the UTXO though, if I haven‚Äôt submitted the zero fee parent yet? ^^
18:11 <instagibbs> optional args will get ya there, just did it for my own testing
18:11 <instagibbs> e.g.
18:11 <instagibbs> bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcwallet=test signrawtransactionwithwallet 0300000001de7615100656cdc2f8fd0217fbbae0d7c6cea020c7d9f64ada16d269db6491bf0000000000fdffffff0100ed94000000000016001400991cdadccdf30cb5a04663b0371cb433a095b400000000 '[{"txid": "bf9164db69d216da4af6d9c720a0cec6d7e0bafb1702fdf8c2cd5606101576de", "vout": 0, "scriptPubKey":
18:11 <instagibbs> "001400991cdadccdf30cb5a04663b0371cb433a095b4", "amount": "0.09765625"}]'
18:11 <Murch[m]> I see, lemme try
18:12 <Murch[m]> (that‚Äôs not mentioned in the createrawtransaction doc, I think)
18:12 <rkrux55> yeah the signtx needs another arg passing in the prev tx details
18:12 <instagibbs> rkrux55 is there an equiv for this in PSBT? I can't recall
18:13 <rkrux55> I'm not sure and would need to check, the PSBT would contain the prev output I'd assume
18:13 <instagibbs> would need ot make sure the utxo *can* be added without the parent in mempool
18:14 <instagibbs> once it's in the PSBT it should work fine 
18:18 <rkrux55> yes good point
18:22 <Murch[m]> instagibbs: I have been trying to use `createpsbt` to make the child transaction with the yet-to-be-created input
18:22 <instagibbs> utxoupdatepsbt might need to be extended with a new option, "prevtx" which takes the entire serialized prevtx?
18:22 <Murch[m]> I used the "scriptPubKey.hex" value from the decoded parent transaction for the input
18:22 <Murch[m]> I still keep getting an incomplete tx, any hints for me?
18:23 <instagibbs> hmmmm, incomplete message from signraw? does it add any data or nothing
18:23 <instagibbs> If you share steps I can locally recreate
18:23 <instagibbs> dm or whatever
18:38 <Murch[m]> "package_msg": "success",
18:38 <Murch[m]> woooot
18:38 <instagibbs> ü§ù was the prevtx arg in signrawtransactionwith*
18:38 <Murch[m]>       "txid": "665f49042e533bcacd3a73fcbe3ac3864705d33af2560f151cd6b289ab3c8272",
18:38 <Murch[m]>       "txid": "55130f1c87e0fc49d053204f5281b29cdd3775ecf327b92c11fa742a3898c7c1",
18:39 <Murch[m]> Anyone got 55130f1c87e0fc49d053204f5281b29cdd3775ecf327b92c11fa742a3898c7c1 in their memepool?
18:39 <Murch[m]> mempool.space got it
18:39 <Murch[m]> and the 0-fee parent
18:40 <instagibbs> https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/30873 in case I'm overlooking something and it's already possible, or it's a good feature for 29.0 for someone to hack on...
18:45 <Murch[m]>  hernanmarino: You should have some coins
19:30 <hernanmarino> Murch: Thanks !
