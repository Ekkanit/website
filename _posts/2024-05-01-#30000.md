## Notes

- An orphan transaction is a transaction with missing inputs. The p2p code uses a [`TxOrphanage`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/842f7fdf786fcbbdf3df40522945813404f8a397/src/net_processing.cpp#L1079-L1081) to store orphan
  transactions, to be reconsidered later if/when its parent transaction(s) are submitted to mempool.
  There are two ways this can happen:

    - [`ProcessOrphanTx`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/842f7fdf786fcbbdf3df40522945813404f8a397/src/net_processing.cpp#L3366), which is called at the start of each `ProcessMessages`, pops orphans from a
      [work set](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/842f7fdf786fcbbdf3df40522945813404f8a397/src/txorphanage.h#L84-L85) that is [updated](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/842f7fdf786fcbbdf3df40522945813404f8a397/src/net_processing.cpp#L3238) whenever a parent transaction is accepted to mempool.

    - When a low-feerate parent is paired with its child in the
      orphanage to be submitted together as a package. This happens in two locations:
        - [when a transaction fails for being low feerate](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/842f7fdf786fcbbdf3df40522945813404f8a397/src/net_processing.cpp#L4666-L4675)
        - [when a low feerate parent is downloaded again](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/842f7fdf786fcbbdf3df40522945813404f8a397/src/net_processing.cpp#L4546-L4557)
      This "opportunistic 1-parent-1-child (1p1c) package submission" logic was added in PR [#28970](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28970).

- An orphan can be removed in a few different ways:

    - When it is [successfully submitted to mempool](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/842f7fdf786fcbbdf3df40522945813404f8a397/src/net_processing.cpp#L3240).

    - If it is [confirmed or conflicted in a block](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/842f7fdf786fcbbdf3df40522945813404f8a397/src/txorphanage.cpp#L214).

    - If the peer that sent this orphan [disconnects](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/842f7fdf786fcbbdf3df40522945813404f8a397/src/txorphanage.cpp#L97).

    - After it has been in the orphanage for [more than 20 minutes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/842f7fdf786fcbbdf3df40522945813404f8a397/src/txorphanage.cpp#L131-L132).

    - If it is [randomly selected for eviction](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/842f7fdf786fcbbdf3df40522945813404f8a397/src/txorphanage.cpp#L141-L147) when the orphanage reaches maximum capacity.

    - If it is [found to be invalid](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/842f7fdf786fcbbdf3df40522945813404f8a397/src/net_processing.cpp#L3222) for some reason other than missing inputs. For example, a
      transaction may be missing two parents, and we have only accepted one of them to mempool so
      far. In that case, we keep the orphan and will reconsider it again after the second parent is submitted.

- Different transactions can have the same txid but different witnesses, i.e. different wtxids. For
  example, a same-txid-different-witness transaction can have an invalid signature (and thus be
invalid) or a larger witness (but same fee and thus lower feerate).

    - In previous review clubs, we have covered same-txid-different-witness transactions in relation to [transaction broadcasts](/22261) and [mempool replacements](/24007).

    - We also covered adding `Txid` vs `Wtxid` type-safety to `TxOrphanage` in a [previous review club](/28107).

- Prior to this PR, the `TxOrphanage` is [indexed by `Txid`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/842f7fdf786fcbbdf3df40522945813404f8a397/src/txorphanage.h#L82) and, when considering a new transaction
in `AddTx`, [immediately fails](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/842f7fdf786fcbbdf3df40522945813404f8a397/src/txorphanage.cpp#L26-L28) if the new transaction's txid matches that of an existing entry.

    - [`TxOrphanage::HaveTx`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/842f7fdf786fcbbdf3df40522945813404f8a397/src/txorphanage.cpp#L172-L180) takes a `GenTxid` to query the data structure by either txid or wtxid.

    - `HaveTx` is primarily [called](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/842f7fdf786fcbbdf3df40522945813404f8a397/src/net_processing.cpp#L2298) by `AlreadyHaveTx` which also accepts a `GenTxid`.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)? What was your review approach?

1. Why would we want to allow multiple transactions with the same txid to exist in the `TxOrphanage`
   at the same time? What kind of situation does this prevent?

1. What are some examples of same-txid-different-witness orphans? (Bonus points if you can write a test case in the functional test for your example).

1. Let's consider the effects of only allowing 1 entry per txid. What happens if a malicious peer sends us a mutated version of the orphan transaction, where the parent is not low feerate? What needs to happen for us to end up accepting this child to mempool? (There are multiple answers).

1. Let's consider the effects if we have a 1p1c package (where the parent is low feerate and must be submitted with its child). What needs to happen for us to end up accepting the correct parent+child package to mempool?

1. Instead of allowing multiple transactions with the same txid (where we are obviously wasting some space on a version we will not accept), should we allow a transaction to replace an existing entry in the `TxOrphanage`? What would be the requirements for replacement?

1. Where in the code do we check whether the orphanage contains a transaction? Is the query done by wtxid, txid, or both? (Hint: there are at least 5).

1. This PR removes the ability to query the orphanage by txid, since the `TxOrphanage` no longer has an index by txid. Is that okay, and why or why not?
