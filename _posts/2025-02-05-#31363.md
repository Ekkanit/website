## Notes

### Cluster Mempool Motivation and Background

Skip this section if you are just interested in reviewing the code and don't need to hear the pitch for why.

The primary goal of [Cluster Mempool](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/cluster-mempool/)
(tracked [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/30289)) is to enable the mempool to more
intelligently assess which transactions would be most incentive compatible to keep. In simple terms "which transactions
would earn a miner the most in fees?" The complexity of incentive compatibility assessment comes from dependencies
between transactions, i.e. spending relationships.

If the motivations for this project are unclear to you, try to spend up to 60min on these reading materials:

- "But aren't fees a trivially small portion of block rewards? Why do we care so much?"
  - One of the biggest problems we want to solve is the asymmetry between how we decide what to evict and what goes into blocks: it's possible
    that [the first transaction we would evict is also the first transaction we would mine](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27677#eviction-mining-not-opposite).
  - An original motivation for trying to come up with a metric for "incentive compatibility" was within the context of
    [RBF pinning](https://gist.github.com/glozow/25d9662c52453bd08b4b4b1d3783b9ff#mining-score-of-a-mempool-transaction); our
current feerate-based approach causes us to reject transactions that would be more incentive compatible, creating
censorship problems.

- "Why is cluster-tracking the solution for incentive compatibility?"
  - [This Delving post](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/mempool-incentive-compatibility/553) provides a great explanation of why the question of incentive
    compatibility is complicated and why tracking clusters is necessary for a complete solution.
  - One of the benefits of Topologically Restricted Until Confirmation is to have an effective cluster limit within
the existing framework of ancestor/descendant limits (limit of cluster count 2 is the equivalent of limiting ancestor
and descendant counts to 2). However, a limit of 2 is quite prohibitive.
  - We talked about clusters in previous review club meetings about [auto-bumping unconfirmed UTXOs in coin selection](/26152)
    (which added `CTxMmemPool::GatherClusters`) and [v3 transactions](/25038).

Mempool transactions and their dependency relationships can naturally be represented as a directed [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics))
where nodes represent transactions and edges represent UTXO spending relationships. This graph may contain multiple connected
components, each called a _cluster_. A transaction's cluster includes all of the transactions it is connected to, which
can be defined recursively: all parents and children (nodes with an edge to or from this one), each of their parents and children, etc.

Cluster Mempool includes some large work components, including (1) adding cluster linearization algorithms which are
used to order (and thus compare) transactions by incentive compatibility, (2) changing the mempool's internal structure
to enable cluster tracking and always maintain a linearization order, and (3) upgrading RBF, eviction, and mining to
use the improved incentive compatibility assessments. This PR is pretty much only relevant to the second component; you
can review it without knowing anything about the cluster linearization algorithm or specific RBF
rules. The code for the first component has been merged (see [PR #30126](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30126)
and its followups), and work-in-progress code for the third component can be found at [PR #28676](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28676)).

Here is everything you need to know about linearization for this PR:

- A linearization is _topologically valid_ if it ensures that a parent transaction appears somewhere before its child.
There are often multiple valid linearizations for the same cluster, and linearization L1 is better than L2 if taking the
first N bytes of L1 would yield higher fees than taking the first N bytes of L2. The _optimal_ linearization of a
cluster is better or as good as all the others.
- Computation needed for linearization scales with the size of the cluster, which is why their size needs to be limited.
- A cluster requires re-linearization each time a transaction is added or removed.

If you have more time to spend on background or need more convincing, here is additional OPTIONAL reading material.

- [BIP 431](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0431.mediawiki) provides an overview of why RBF pinning
  is problematic and some of the other pieces that come together to address its issues.
- [This Delving post](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/introduction-to-cluster-linearization/1032) provides an overview of the
  algorithms used in cluster linearization.
- [This Delving post](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/cluster-mempool-rbf-thoughts/156) discusses how to evaluate
  replacements using feerate diagrams, which are enabled with cluster mempool.

### Background on Mempool Architecture and Interfaces

Skip this section if you are already familiar with current mempool code.

"The Mempool" usually refers to the class [`CTxMemPool`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8fa10edcd1706a1f0dc9d8c3adbc8efa3c7755bf/src/txmempool.h#L303).
This class holds a map of `CTxMemPoolEntry`s and other supporting data structures. It is responsible for keeping itself
internally consistent, and much of the code is dedicated to dealing with dependency relationships.

Outside of the `CTxMemPool` class, here are the major pieces of mempool functionality to think about
while reviewing cluster mempool:

- [Mempool validation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8fa10edcd1706a1f0dc9d8c3adbc8efa3c7755bf/src/validation.cpp#L437-L1938)
decides what unconfirmed transactions to keep in memory.
- [Block connection](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8fa10edcd1706a1f0dc9d8c3adbc8efa3c7755bf/src/validation.cpp#L3237-L3240)
removes mempool transactions that would be inconsistent with chainstate.
- [Block disconnection](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8fa10edcd1706a1f0dc9d8c3adbc8efa3c7755bf/src/validation.cpp#L296-L390)
(aka reorganization) resubmits the transactions from the previous chain that are no longer in the new chain.
- [Block assembly](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8fa10edcd1706a1f0dc9d8c3adbc8efa3c7755bf/src/node/miner.cpp#L107-L428)
(aka mining) fills a block template using mempool transactions, optimizing for fee revenue.
- [Mempool eviction](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8fa10edcd1706a1f0dc9d8c3adbc8efa3c7755bf/src/txmempool.cpp#L1158-L1200)
is an internal process that decides what transactions to delete when the memory usage exceeds configured limits. It is
triggered in multiple places, including Mempool validation and Block disconnection.

On master, Bitcoin Core's mempool does not track clusters, but it does track ancestor and descendant sets.
[`CTxMemPoolEntry`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8fa10edcd1706a1f0dc9d8c3adbc8efa3c7755bf/src/kernel/mempool_entry.h#L79-L106)
stores references to its parents and children and tracks the {count, total vsize, total fees} of its ancestor and
descendant sets.  Each time a transaction is added or removed, `CTxMemPool` uses the references to traverse ancestors
and/or descendants recursively, updating the cached ancestor and descendant information.

### Design and Usage with Existing Mempool

While the current (on master) `CTxMemPool` class does not contain a data structure dedicated to storing the graph representation
itself, "the graph already exists" in the form of `CTxMemPoolEntry`'s parent/child references and cached
ancestor/descendant information.

The responsibility of keeping this graph up-to-date and within its specified limits largely belongs to `CTxMemPool`, but
occasionally bleeds out to other areas. For example, in mempool validation, `MemPoolAccept` queries `CTxMemPool` for the
ancestors of a transaction in order to:

- Calculate whether this transaction would exceed the ancestor/descendant limits. However, sometimes, when evaluating a
  replacement, we apply an [RBF Carve Out](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8fa10edcd1706a1f0dc9d8c3adbc8efa3c7755bf/src/validation.cpp#L950-L984),
literally increasing the limit by 1, to avoid double-counting the replacement and to-be-replaced transactions. Yuck!
- Check whether a TRUC transaction meets its additional topology restrictions. However we first need to [aggregate the
  in-package and in-mempool ancestors](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8fa10edcd1706a1f0dc9d8c3adbc8efa3c7755bf/src/validation.cpp#L1551-L1558).
- When evaluating a package, the precise ancestor/descendant counts of each package transaction and connected mempool
  transactions are not calculated before submission. Instead, the [aggregate package count and
size](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/1172bc4157eefe80d1aaf0b56459857ec651e535/src/validation.cpp#L1141-L1146) are used. This
approximation avoids complexity, but can result in overestimation for certain topologies.

These examples illustrate current accuracy problems with enforcing topology limits and the unclear boundary between
`CTxMemPool` and its clients in performing this task.

PR #31363 adds a `TxGraph` class, used by `CTxMemPool` to encapsulate the transaction graph.
The [PR description](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31363#issue-2687950417) provides an overview of its
interface and implementation. `TxGraph` supports "main" and "staged" changes: transaction additions and removals can be
staged and later discarded or applied. Additionally, removals and additions are applied lazily, allowing them to be
batched.

### Design and Usage with TxGraph

In contrast, you can view the full [cluster mempool implementation PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28676) to see the usage of `TxGraph`
and how these new functions are used in the surrounding logic:

- [This commit](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/f829febbb578a44c2a369ec307185eff9374e694)
  makes `CTxMemPoolentry` derive from `TxGraph::Ref`.
- Mempool validation [stages the addition of the new transaction(s) to a changeset](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/682aab426e13d065a8c4a3e396e91e6ad4db0c35/src/validation.cpp#L899),
which stages changes to the mempool txgraph.  To check cluster limits, it just
  [queries](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/682aab426e13d065a8c4a3e396e91e6ad4db0c35/src/validation.cpp#L1347-L1350)
whether it is oversized. It no longer needs to know what the ancestor/descendant limits are or apply carveouts in a
replacement.
- RBF incentive compatibility simply entails
  [asking](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/682aab426e13d065a8c4a3e396e91e6ad4db0c35/src/validation.cpp#L1017)
the txgraph if the staged subgraph's feerate diagram improves upon the original feerate diagram.
- `PrioritiseTransaction`
  [now](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/682aab426e13d065a8c4a3e396e91e6ad4db0c35/src/txmempool.cpp#L596)
just calls `TxGraph::SetTransactionFee()` and expects it to handle everything from there.
  [Before](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8fa10edcd1706a1f0dc9d8c3adbc8efa3c7755bf/src/txmempool.cpp#L913-L947),
it needed to iterate through all ancestors and descendants to update their cached fees.
- Additionally, prior to being queried for oversize or feerate diagrams, no cluster calculation and linearization is done.

Taking a look at PR #28676 can help illustrate some of the benefits of having `TxGraph`, including:

- The mechanical details of updating the dependency graph and its impact on incentive compatibility are abstracted away
  from higher level mempool logic.
  - `CTxMemPool`'s code is less cluttered with graph-wrangling logic. Lots of code is removed, and the much of the
    remaining ancestor/descendant tracking can be cleaned up in the future.
  - `TxGraph` doesn't know that it represents a mempool. It doesn't know what a transaction is, and
    doesn't care whether elements are being added and removed for replacements or block (dis)connection. It has a
smaller scope and well-specified behavior.
- We now have the ability to reason accurately about the addition of multiple transactions and removal of their
  collective replacements.
- Batched updates improve the overall performance of mempool operations.
- Deferred linearization also can allow for slower linearization improvements to be applied later, e.g. in the
  background, giving us the benefits of optimal linearizations without sacrificing performance.

### Implementation

The author has written recommendations for reviewing the code [in this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31363#issuecomment-2557349002).

The PR is split into largely split into feature and optimization commits. The features are introduced iteratively, so it
may be easiest to review the PR in chunks of commits for each feature if the overall changes seem intimidating.  Another
approach is to first read through the overall changes to `TxGraph` and `TxGraphImpl`'s respective interfaces, and then
review implementation. You could also review the interface, then the fuzzer implementation, then the real
implementation.

These notes are split into three sections by feature to make it easy to review a subset of the PR corresponding to the
amount of time you have to review it.

#### Basic TxGraph, Lazy and Oversized

This section includes code up to [txgraph: (optimization) avoid per-group vectors for clusters & dependencies](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/5e55a584a77a8dfa357eaf016f177d72cb92a218).

A `TxGraph` has a vector of `Entry`s (where each entry is a single transaction), and a vector of `Cluster`s (which represent clusters as defined earlier).  It also has
queues of "work" to do which may or may not need to be completed in order to perform certain tasks or answer external
queries. Some tasks have other tasks as prerequisites.

This is the order in which things have to be resolved:

1. `ApplyRemovals`: Apply all of the queued removals.
2. `SplitAll`: Split up clusters if they contain components that are no longer connected to each other.
3. `GroupClusters`: Calculate what clusters would need to be merged if dependencies are applied. However, these changes are not yet applied.
4. `ApplyDependencies`: Apply new dependencies and merge clusters as computed in the previous step.
5. `Relinearize`: Relinearize clusters.

Much of the work is done lazily. For example, calling `RemoveTransaction` does not actually mean its etry is deleted, just that
the index has been added to `m_to_remove`. However, `TxGraph` cannot answer a call to `Exists` without first calling `ApplyRemovals`.

An **Oversized** `TxGraph` is one that has at least one cluster that violates the cluster count or size limits.
- A `TxGraph` only knows if it is oversized after it has completed steps 1-3.
- When a `TxGraph` is oversized, mutation functions (like `RemoveTransaction` and `AddDependency`) and
  `GetIndividualFeerate` can still be called, but inspection functions like `GetChunkFeerate` are unavailable because we won't
merge or linearize clusters that are oversized. (`GetChunkFeerate` becomes `GetMainChunkFeerate` in a later commit).
- Additionally, step 4 will not proceed if the txgraph is oversized; step 5 is thus also impossible.

The `GroupClusters` function implements [union-find](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure), a
favorite amongst software engineering interviewers.

#### Staging Support

This section includes code up to ["txgraph: (feature) add staging support"](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/79647fd58dc7152eb1dc4e09cc56db845608352d).

This feature allows users of `TxGraph` to stage changes and then apply or discard them, much like git.

Much of the `TxGraph` members are grouped together as a `ClusterSet`. This refactor is done so that a `TxGraph` can have multiple **subgraphs** or **levels** represented as
`ClusterSet`s: main (level 0) and staged (level 1).

[Creating](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/79647fd58dc7152eb1dc4e09cc56db845608352d#diff-c25ebcc6e4dc9c9bb21462f796fbb470cee3f0ff1e77bfc4033f4e8460f4482cR1464)
a staged subgraph requires first applying removals. The staged subgraph creates copies of information from the main graph.

<!-- FIXME: more on impl -->

#### Specialized Functionality

This section includes the rest of [#31363](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31363), but also [#31444](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31444).

There are various functions added to `TxGraph` to obtain specialized information:
- `CountDistinctClusters` and `GetMainStagingDiagram` are used in RBF logic.
- `GetBlockBuilder` is used in block assembly.
- `GetWorstMainChunk` is used in mempool eviction.

It may be useful to look at the code surrounding mempool to understand why each of the functions are necessary.
