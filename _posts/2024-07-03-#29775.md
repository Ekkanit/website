## Notes

- Recommended reading:
    - Please also try to [read the BIP PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1601) and, if possible, review it in tandem with the PR. The BIP and the PR should be in sync with each other and ideally the BIP should be a clear description of the key parts of the PR.
    - Testnet reset [discussion on the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/9bL00vRj7OU).
    - A helpful [deep dive into the block storm bug by Jameson Lopp](https://blog.lopp.net/the-block-storms-of-bitcoins-testnet/).
    - A great [explanation of the timewarp attack on Bitcoin SE by David Harding](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/75831/what-is-time-warp-attack-and-how-does-it-work-in-general/75834#75834)
- Bitcoin core supports three test networks out of the box: Regtest, Testnet, and Signet. There also exist some custom Signet variants like Mutinynet. At this point, the current Testnet has been running for 12 years. However, the current Testnet is actually Testnet 3. It was introduced in [PR #1392](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1392). Documentation on how exactly Testnet 1 and 2 broke is not available but it appears that they fell victim to high fluctuation in mining power. Remember that around this time the first ASIC miners entered the market while Testnet was probably still mostly mined by CPUs and maybe the occasional GPU.
- Testnet 3 features a Proof of Work exception rule, known as the 20-min exception. This rule was designed to prevent the chain from getting stuck again due to hash power fluctuation. However, a bug in this exception leads to so-called block storms, large numbers of blocks being mined in quick succession. This is the main reason Testnet 3 is so far ahead of mainnet even though it started much later. The bug was recently [exploited on purpose](https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/bitcoin-testnet-could-need-reset-13-years-jameson-lopp-griefing/) for an extended period of time to highlight the issue.
- Testnet 4 still includes the 20-min exception but adds a mitigation for the block storm issue.
- The pull request also includes a fix for the timewarp attack, an attack that is still possible on mainnet today. A fix for this was proposed as part of the [Great Consensus Cleanup](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/consensus-cleanup-soft-fork/) but failed to get the necessary support as a softfork so far.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)? What was your review approach?
2. Why reset Testnet in the first place? Were there any arguments against the reset?
3. What is the message in the Genesis block in Testnet 3 and why (reference the code)?
4. Aside from the consensus changes, what differences do you see between Testnet 4 and Testnet 3, particularly the chain params?
5. Pick a single chain param that you don't know/remember the meaning of. Look up what it does and explain it in one sentence.
6. How does the 20-min exception rule work in Testnet 3? How does this lead to the block storm bug? Please try to reference the code.
7. How is the block storm bug fixed in the PR? What other fixes were discussed in the PR?
8. Why was the time warp fix included in the PR? Hint: This came up in the PR discussion.
9. How does the time warp fix work? Where does the fix originate from? Can you think of any other ways to fix it?
10. How do you start your node with Testnet 4? What happens when you start it just with `-testnet=1` after Testnet 4 is included?
11. The PR and ML discussions included many further concerns and ideas that were not addressed in the code of the PR. Pick the one you found most interesting and give a short summary. Do you think this is still a concern and should be addressed?
12. Do you have ideas for additional test cases? What makes Testnet 4 features tricky to test?
13. Why is it interesting to embed special scripts into the chain as test cases? What makes this useful beyond bitcoin core?
14. What expectations do you have for such a change before you would include it in a release? For example, would you reset the genesis block one more time?
