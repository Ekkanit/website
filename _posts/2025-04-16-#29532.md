## Notes

### Overview of Bitcoin Core’s Coin Selection

[Coin selection](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/q/32145) refers to the
process of picking inputs to fund transactions. Bitcoin Core uses currently
four different algorithms that each produce candidate input sets, and then picks
one of those input sets to fund the transaction. Here is a rough sketch of how
the algorithms work:

- "[Knapsack](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/q/1077)"
  Do 1000 random walks selecting and deselecting available coins, remember the input set that
  overshot the target the least. Knapsack will usually create a change output,
  but can create a changeless transaction when the overshoot is exactly 0, or
  all funds are used.
- [Single Random Draw (SRD)](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/pr29532/src/wallet/coinselection.cpp#L536)
  Randomly pick UTXOs from the available coins until enough funds are selected
  to build a transaction with a change output of a reasonable amount.
- [Branch'n'Bound (BnB)](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/q/119919)
  Deterministically search all combinations of the available coins to find the input set that is the _[least
  wasteful](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/113625)_ that does not create a
  change output.
- [CoinGrinder](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/pr29532/src/wallet/coinselection.cpp#L325)
  Deterministically search all combinations of the available coins to find the
  input set that has the _lowest weight_ that does create a change output.

| Algorithm  | Deterministic  | Creates Change Outputs | Notes on Special Cases |
|---|---|---|---|
| Knapsack | No  | Usually | Selects all available UTXOs if `target` is exceeded, but `target + minChange` is not reached. |
| Single Random Draw | No | Always | Will only return a selection if `target + minChange` is exceeded. |
| Branch and Bound | Yes | Never | Disabled when SFFO is active. Only returns a selection if a combination produces a changeless transaction (i.e. one combination sums to a value between `target` and `target + cost_of_change`. |
| CoinGrinder | Yes | Always | Disabled below 30 ṩ/vB. Will only return a selection if `target + minChange` is exceeded. |

This pull request is focused on the tests for the Branch and Bound algorithm.

### Motivation

The author of this PR [noticed](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27754)
that many coin selection tests use coin selection parameters that generally do
not appear in production use. The unusual parameters could lead to unexpected
coin selection behavior.

The quirky outcomes would cause confusion when writing or reviewing new tests
because coin selection results could be heavier or lighter (in transaction weight) than expected,
selection could be unstable when it was expected to be deterministic, waste
scores could diverge from the obvious values, or changeful solutions could
unexpectedly be preferred to changeless solutions.

For example, when the `cost_of_change` parameter was set to 0, any selection
result would be interpreted as [resulting in a changeless transaction](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28366/files#diff-d473ed8396f9451afb848923cfcfaa630c9811a78e07f3ae1ffd3a65da218accL809-L819), i.e.,
when `cost_of_change` was 0 and Single Random Draw picked a 1₿-input for a 0.1₿
selection target, the result would be evaluated as if dropping 0.9₿ to fees
instead of creating a ~0.9₿ change output.

Additionally, most coin selection tests use a feerate of 0 ṩ/vB, which results
in the amount of UTXOs being equal to their [_effective
value_](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/q/103654/5406) (amount - input fee).
This makes it easy to predict the change amount from the input amounts, but
e.g., means that the fees for a heavy or light transaction are the same (namely
0).

The described issues were [partially
fixed](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28366) by removing the
double-meaning of `cost_of_change`. This pull request is the start of an
effort to rewrite the coin selection tests to use non-zero feerates, and create
UTXO per their effective values, so that coin selection may happen at non-zero
feerates and more closely emulate in production use.

### How to review the changes

It is recommended to review commit by commit.
The first commit adds the new test suite `coinselection_tests.cpp` including
default coin selection parameters, and helper functions for creating tests.
Each commit after that transplants one set of tests for the BnB coin selection
algorithm from the old coin selection test suite `coinselector_tests.cpp` to
the new suite. The new tests should provide at least the same coverage as the
old tests, please keep an eye on whether the test coverage may have been
reduced.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

It was considered to move the test and then refactor them, but one confusing
aspect of the old test suite was the high number of overloaded helper
functions. It was thus decided that building up the new test suite step by step
would be easier to follow and might give opportunities for additional clean-up.


## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)? What was your review approach?

2. What are the four coin selection algorithms used by Bitcoin Core? How do they differ?

3. What is the `effective_value` of a UTXO? How is it calculated?

4. Bonus question: What criterion is used to [pick from among the algorithms’ selection results](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/pr29532/src/wallet/spend.cpp#L690)?

5. Why might have so many of the original tests have used a feerate of 0 ṩ/vB?
   How does the [`AddCoins(…)`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/9773192b833fe0d0e071b0a75f72aab82cb124ef#diff-36088c93368e137d955348aba223985bd4f198f2aaecd626c830f4612ca884c8R56-R62)
  function in the new test suite address the same concern?

6. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a helper function like [`TestBnBSuccess(…)`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/66200b3ffa21605fc3234ccbda7b424381f3319a#diff-36088c93368e137d955348aba223985bd4f198f2aaecd626c830f4612ca884c8R94-R108)?

8. What does the ["clone skipping test"](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/9d7db26b7b556784c16e41572ba2d2edc6dd6c24#diff-36088c93368e137d955348aba223985bd4f198f2aaecd626c830f4612ca884c8R132-R136) test? How does the [`expected_result`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/9d7db26b7b556784c16e41572ba2d2edc6dd6c24#diff-36ddaeb9e3a5c1aaaccd6b1ed6c770e8344e33dbfd4876b5f0726d84ab47cbabL230-L249) in the original test line up with what you would pick manually at low and at high feerates?

9. What is the motivation for the ["Overshoot upper bound"](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/65521465da036616172f4fbeef2855b8ddefd75f#diff-36088c93368e137d955348aba223985bd4f198f2aaecd626c830f4612ca884c8R141-R142) to use different values than the original?

10. What characteristic makes a set of UTXOs "expensive to search" for BnB?
