## Notes

- An orphan transaction is a transaction with missing inputs. The p2p code uses a [`TxOrphanage`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/842f7fdf786fcbbdf3df40522945813404f8a397/src/net_processing.cpp#L1079-L1081) to store orphan transactions, to be reconsidered later if/when its parent transaction(s) are known.

    - We have discussed `TxOrphanage` in previous review club meetings [n21527](/21527) and [n30000](/30000).

- [PR #30793](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30793) adds a new RPC, `getorphantxs`, to
  return the contents of the node's orphanage at that moment.

    - Its format is similar to the `getrawmempool` RPC, which also returns information on all transactions in the mempool. Lower verbosity returns the txids,
      and higher verbosity returns fields about each entry.

    - Its purpose is similar to that of `getrawaddrman`. Most likely, developers will be the main users.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)? What was your review approach?

1. What is an orphan transaction? At what point do transactions enter the orphanage (can you find the code)?

1. What command can you run to get a list of available RPCs?

1. What is the benefit of the first commit, which creates a `public OrphanTxBase` and extends that in a `protected struct OrphanTx`?

1. What is the difference between `public`, `protected`, and `private`? When should you use each for
   a class member/method?

1. If an RPC has a non-string argument, does anything special need to be done to handle it?

1. What specifically does it mean that the RPC is
   ["hidden"](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/8ec094959dc6afd46a709190d2deb58a50593fb7#diff-9c5b83de6dc84af277e352c88b9291aa44340a3c75f572a0b51661eb0a838de9R1131)? Why `hidden` and not `net`?

1. Why can't we just directly access the orphanage from the RPC code? Why don't we just add a
   PeerManager function that returns a reference to the `TxOrphanage`, which would be more extensible?

1. What is the maximum size of the result from this RPC? Is there a limit to how many orphans are retained? Is there a
   limit to how much time orphans can stay in the orphanage?

1. Bonus question: Since when has there been a maximum orphanage size (can you find the commit or PR using `git log`, `git blame`, or github search)?

1. [These two
   items](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/8ec094959dc6afd46a709190d2deb58a50593fb7#diff-84c7a7f36362b9724c31e5dec9879b2f81eae0d0addbc9c0933c3558c577de65R255-R256) suggest that the RPC can be called with a boolean `verbose` or an integer `verbosity`. What does `True` correspond to, and what does `False` correspond to, in the function [`ParseVerbosity`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/97578ba49ab22ae156de907a403fa0aa3b64a80a)?

1. Using this RPC, would we be able to tell how long a transaction has been in the orphanage? If yes, how would you do it?

1. Using this RPC, would we be able to tell what the inputs of an orphan transaction are? If yes, how would you do it?

1. Does the functional test cover the new code thoroughly? How did you evaluate coverage?
